# Rakshak

**AI-powered women's safety platform for Chennai, India**

Rakshak is a dual-interface Flutter application that provides real-time crime risk assessment using machine learning. Women in Chennai can check safety levels at any location, while police departments monitor high-risk zones and respond to incidents through a web dashboard.

---

## Problem Statement

Women in urban areas like Chennai face uncertainty about safety when traveling to unfamiliar locations. Traditional crime data is reactive and not accessible in real-time. Rakshak solves this by:

- Predicting crime risk (Low/Medium/High) for any location using ML trained on Chennai crime data
- Providing instant safety awareness through a mobile app
- Enabling police to proactively monitor high-risk zones and respond faster to incidents

- **3-Screen Flow**: Home → Scan Animation → Risk Result
- **Location Detection**: Auto-detect GPS location or enter PIN code manually
- **Visual Risk Indicators**: Color-coded badges (🟢 Low, 🟠 Moderate, 🔴 High)
- **Emergency SOS**: 3-second hold button to alert authorities
- **Incident Reporting**: Report suspicious activity directly from the app

### 🖥️ Police Web Dashboard

```

**Request Flow:**
1. User opens app → GPS location detected
2. App sends `POST` request to API Gateway with location + time features
3. Lambda invokes ML model with 17 features (lat, lng, time, area, historical data)
4. Model returns risk prediction (Low/Medium/High) + response time estimate
5. App displays color-coded risk badge and safety recommendations

**ML Model Features:**
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `pincode` - Location identifiers
- `hour`, `is_night`, `is_evening`, `is_weekend`, `day_of_week` - Temporal features
- `area_encoded`, `neighborhood_encoded` - Categorical encodings
- `response_time_minutes`, `reporting_delay_minutes` - Historical police response data
- `signal_count_last_7d`, `signal_count_last_30d`, `signal_density_ratio` - Incident frequency

### ML Explainability (SHAP)

Rakshak uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain why the ML model predicts a location as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW risk.

**Example: Why is this location HIGH RISK at 11 PM?**

Key factors contributing to HIGH RISK prediction:
- `reporting_delay_minutes = 45` → **+0.13** (long delays in reporting crimes)
- `latitude = 13.083` → **+0.11** (historically high-crime area)
- `response_time_minutes = 18` → **+0.08** (slower police response)
- `pincode = 600001` → **+0.09** (high-crime postal code)
- `is_night = 1` → **+0.02** (nighttime hour)

**Top Features by Importance:**
1. **latitude** (0.35 mean SHAP value) - Geographic location is the strongest predictor
2. **response_time_minutes** (0.20) - Faster response = safer area
3. **pincode** (0.20) - Postal codes capture neighborhood-level patterns
4. **reporting_delay_minutes** (0.18) - Longer delays indicate unsafe areas
5. **area_encoded** (0.15) - Administrative area classification

See [SCREENSHOTS.md](SCREENSHOTS.md) for detailed SHAP visualizations and explanations.
